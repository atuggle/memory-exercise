# Memory React

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Dependency installation
Run `npm i` in the checked-out repository.

### Running the app
Run `npm start` in the checked-out repository.

This should start the webpack server on port 3000 and automatically open your browser.  If it doesn't open the browser, simply navigate to [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/).

## Additional Notes
The `npm start` command will start webpack in development mode.  This means that every time you make a change to a file, it will automatically refresh all browser windows connected to the server for you.
